# [Feature/Component Name] Design Document

## Current Context
- Brief overview of the existing system
- Key components and their relationships
- Pain points or gaps being addressed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- List of must-have functionality
- Expected behaviors
- Integration points

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Scalability needs
- Observability requirements
- Security considerations

## Design Decisions

### 1. [Major Decision Area]
Will implement/choose [approach] because:
- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Trade-offs considered

### 2. [Another Decision Area]
Will implement/choose [approach] because:
- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Alternatives considered

## Technical Design

### 1. Core Components
```python
# Key interfaces/classes with type hints
class MainComponent:
    """Core documentation"""
    pass
```

### 2. Data Models
```python
# Key data models with type hints
class DataModel:
    """Model documentation"""
    pass
```

### 3. Integration Points
- How this interfaces with other systems
- API contracts
- Data flow diagrams if needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: [Initial Implementation]
   - Task 1
   - Task 2
   - Expected timeline

2. Phase 2: [Enhancement Phase]
   - Task 1
   - Task 2
   - Expected timeline

3. Phase 3: [Production Readiness]
   - Task 1
   - Task 2
   - Expected timeline

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Key test cases
