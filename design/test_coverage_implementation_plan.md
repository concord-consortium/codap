## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Complex UI Testing**: Testing canvas/WebGL components may be challenging
   - Mitigation: Use specialized testing libraries and focus on functional testing
   
2. **Test Performance**: Large test suite may become slow
   - Mitigation: Implement parallel testing and optimize test execution

3. **MobX/MST Integration**: Reactive state testing can be complex
   - Mitigation: Develop specialized utilities and patterns for testing reactive state

4. **Test Maintenance**: Large test suite may become difficult to maintain
   - Mitigation: Establish clear patterns and shared utilities to reduce duplication

5. **Team Adoption**: Team may struggle to adopt new testing practices
   - Mitigation: Provide comprehensive documentation and training

## Success Criteria

The test coverage enhancement project will be considered successful when:

1. Overall test coverage reaches target thresholds:
   - 80% statement coverage
   - 70% branch coverage
   - 75% function coverage

2. All critical user workflows have E2E test coverage

3. Test execution is reliable with flakiness rate below 1%

4. Test execution time remains reasonable:
   - Unit tests complete in under 2 minutes
   - E2E tests complete in under 10 minutes

5. Team has adopted the testing practices and is actively maintaining tests
