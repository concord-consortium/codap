CODAP
=====
Common Online Data Analysis Platform
------------------------------------
### A Bit of History

Development of this codebase began in 2010 as part of the work of KCP Technologies' NSF-supported [Data Games](http://play.ccssgames.com/) project. In a data game, the data generated by playing the game flows into CODAP for analysis and visualization. In a well-designed data game, the player cannot progress very far without using the data to inform and refine a strategy.

Starting in 2012 CODAP became the data analysis environment for [Concord Consortium](https://concord.org/)'s NSF-supported [InquirySpace](http://concord.org/projects/inquiryspace) project. Developed to promote scientific inquiry in high school science classes, students work with simulations or gather data with probes. The data flow into CODAP for analysis, facilitating hypothesis generation and iteration of experiments.

In April, 2014, CODAP received NSF funding as a [project in its own right](https://concord.org/projects/codap) with the goal of developing a platform that can be used by developers of online curriculum materials that engage learners with data. Initial collaborations are: continuing work with InquirySpace and new work with [OceanTracks](http://oceantracks.org) at [EDC](http://www.edc.org) and [Terra Populus](http://www.terrapop.org) at the [Minnesota Population Center](https://www.pop.umn.edu/index.php). CODAP's success depends on the extent to which a community of developers embraces it as a way to bring dynamic, interactive data science tools to classroom (and other) learning.

### What CODAP Looks Like

What CODAP looks like will depend strongly on the context. But below is a screen shot of CODAP in use with an InquirySpace investigation. The **Terminal Velocity** component is a simulation that is streaming data to CODAP. Note the hierarchical structure of the data in which there are five runs, each containing a time series. Note also the linked selection in which the fourth run and its time series are selected.
