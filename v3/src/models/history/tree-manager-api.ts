     * The shared model is identified by an id inside of the snapshot. The
     * sourceTreeId indicates which tree is sending this update. The new shared
     * model snapshot will not be sent back to this source.
     *
     * Note: The returned promise should only resolve after the shared model has
     * been updated in the manager and in all trees that are using the shared
     * model. The promise does not guarantee that all of the tiles have updated
     * their own objects related to the shared model. In particular when this is
     * called when applying patches from an undo or redo, the tiles will
     * explicitly not update their related objects because they will receive
     * patches that should contain these changes separately.
     *
     * This promise is needed because we need to stop some updating before
     * replaying a history event, and then we need to start it up again
     * afterward. So we need to know when the history event has been fully
     * applied. When the history event includes changes to a shared model, fully
     * applying it means the tree of the shared model has sent its changes to
     * all of the trees that are using it. So when the shared model tree gets
     * the applyPatchesFromManager call it then calls this updateSharedModel and
     * waits for it to resolve before resolving its own promise.
     *
     * The returned promise will also be used when a user event is sent, we need
     * to make sure the manager has received this update message before the
     * tree tells the manager is done modifying the historyEntry. In this case
     * it isn't necessary for the returned promise to wait until all of the
     * trees have received the message. That could be the responsibility of the
     * manager. Perhaps we can simplify this so this call doesn't need to
     * block until all of the trees using the shared model have been notified.
     * That blocking could be the responsibility of the manager after this call
     * is done.

     * When the user does an undo the manager will send the inversePatches of

     * historyEntryId to the tree with `applyPatchesFromManager`.

     * When time traveling is done, the manager will collect all the history
     * events from the current time to the desired time. It will then
     * group all of the patches in these events by tree and send them all to the
     * tree at the same time. This is done with `applyPatchesFromManager`.

     * The tree calling `addHistoryEntry` should wait for the returned promise
     * to resolve and then call a `addTreePatchRecord`. If the tree is also
     * calling `updateSharedModel` it should wait for both the updateSharedModel
     * and the `addHistoryEntry` to resolve before calling `addTreePatchRecord`.

     * entry is because some actions don't have any patches in their own tree

     * want to record the initiating tree action so there is more info for the
