    // required when creating a content model. And in many cases these tile content models
    // are created without passing a type.

    // Because of the intersection it would still mean the sub models would do the right thing,

    // It might also cause problems when code is working with a generic of TileContentModel
    // that code couldn't assume that `model.type` is defined.
    //
    // Since this is optional, it needs a default value, and Unknown seems like the
    // best option for this.
    // I verified that a specific tile content model could not be constructed with:
    //   ImageContentModel.create({ type: "Unknown" }).

    // types.literal so that overrides this less specific use of types.string

    // if a sub type does not override it.
